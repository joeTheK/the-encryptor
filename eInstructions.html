      <h1>Encryptor Instructions</h1>
      <p>Click on the button to either decrypt or encrypt the message you are putting in. A form will pop up asking you for the message and the key you want to encrypt/decrypt with.Type in the messages (with capital letters, spaces or hyphens but no other symbols) and click either the Encrypt it! or Decrypt it! Buttons. It will print out a phrase that looks like nothing but it is correct, this cipher is not meant to be read. (You can also add dashes between the letter with the checkbox at the bottom)</p>

      <h1>Vigenère Cipher</h1>
      <p>The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution. Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher in 1863.</p>

      <h2>This is how it works</h2>
      <p>You can use this table to go letter by letter. Use the top row as your message letter and the left row for the key letter. Then match the letter and there is that encrypted letter. </p>
      <p>So C & D = f and W & O = k</p>
      <img src="VIGTable.jpg" alt="" id="vTable">
      <p>You can also do it algebraically using the equation (M_i + K_i) % 26. Where M is the message’s number if based alphabetically (A=0, B=1,...Z=25), and K is the key’s number. I is also the number of the message.</p>
      <p>So C & D = 2 + 3 = 5 || f and W & O = (22 + 14) % 26 = 10 || k</p>
