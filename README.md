# the-encryptor

This was my final for my freshman coding class. I coded this using javascript, HTML, and CSS
and it was my first large scale project.

It uses the Vigen√®re cipher, and was a complicated jumble of javascript. This was at the beginning
of my coding career in highschool and the first full website I made alone.
